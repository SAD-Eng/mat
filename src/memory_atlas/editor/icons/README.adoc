= Icons

All icons are from the open source Material Design Icons pack from the
Pictogrammers website: https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/.

== Download Icon to SVG

To add a new icon, browse the website and click on the icon you want.
Click the "Copy SVG" <> icon. Create a new file in this directory and name
it matching the website icon name, with .svg extension - paste in the
SVG content, and save.

== Use Icon in the GUI

First, you must open icons.qrc in this directory and add your new icon
file(s) to the list. Next, re-run src/memory_atlas/editor/compile_ui.sh
to recompile the icons.qrc file into ui_icons.py. You can now reference
your icon as with the other icons, i.e. `:/icons/<name>.svg`.
